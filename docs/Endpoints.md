Start by sending a request to `auth/signin` with your e-mail address and
password in a JSON object in the POST data. The response JSON object contains a
token (a hex string); remember that value. Each time you make a request that
requires authentication (the leaderboard and terrain ones, at least, don't),
send the most recent token value as both the `X-Token` and `X-Username`
headers. The response will contain a new token value in the `X-Token` header
with which you should replace your saved token. (You can send the token on every
request and just check for a new one in the response, so you don't have to know
exactly which calls require authentication.)

Example request parameters are given below, along with schemata for the server's
responses.

Memory and console endpoints are from
[bzy-xyz](https://gist.github.com/bzy-xyz/9c4d8c9f9498a2d7983d).

You can access the PTR by changing `screeps.com` to `screeps.com/ptr` in all URLs.

# Manipulating the game world
- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/gen-unique-object-name`
    - post data: `{ type }`
    - response: `{ ok, name }`
    - `type` can be at least "flag" or "spawn"

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/create-flag`
    - post data: `{ room, x, y, name, color, secondaryColor }`
    - response: `{ ok, result: { nModified, ok, upserted: [ { index, _id } ], n }, connection: { host, id, port } }`
    - if the name is new, `result.upserted[0]._id` is the game id of the created flag
    - if not, this moves the flag and the response does not contain the id (but the id doesn't change)
    - `connection` looks like some internal MongoDB thing that is irrelevant to us

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/change-flag`
    - post data: `{ _id, room, x, y }`
    - response: `{ ok, result: { nModified, ok, n }, connection: { host, id, port } }`

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/add-object-intent`
    - post data: `{ _id, room, name, intent }`
    - response: `{ ok, result: { nModified, ok, upserted: [ { index, _id } ], n }, connection: { host, id, port } }`
    - `_id` is the game id of the object to affect (except for destroying structures), `room` is the name of the room it's in
    - this method is used for a variety of actions, depending on the `name` and `intent` parameters
        - remove flag: `name = "remove"`, `intent = {}`
        - destroy structure: `_id = "room"`, `name = "destroyStructure"`, `intent = [ {id: <structure id>, roomName, <room name>, user: <user id>} ]`
            - can destroy multiple structures at once
        - suicide creep: `name = "suicide"`, `intent = {id: <creep id>}`
        - unclaim controller: `name = "unclaim"`, `intent = {id: <controller id>}`
             - intent can be an empty object for suicide and unclaim, but the web interface sends the id in it, as described
        - remove construction site: `name = "remove"`, `intent = {}`

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/set-notify-when-attacked`
    - post data: `{ _id, enabled }`
    - `enabled` is either `true` or `false` (literal values, not strings)
    - response: `{ ok, result: { ok, nModified, n }, connection: { id, host, port } }`

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/create-construction`
    - post data: `{ room, structureType, x, y}`
    - `structureType` is the same value as one of the in-game STRUCTURE_* constants ('road', 'spawn', etc.)
    - `{ ok, result: { ok, n }, ops: [ { type, room, x, y, structureType, user, progress, progressTotal, _id } ], insertedCount, insertedIds }`

# Other
- `https://screeps.com/api/game/time`
    - `{ ok, time }`

- [GET/POST] `https://screeps.com/api/user/code`
    - for pushing or pulling code, as documented at http://support.screeps.com/hc/en-us/articles/203022612

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/api/game/map-stats`
    - post data: `{ rooms: [ <room name> ], statName: "..."}`
    - statName can be "owner0", "claim0", or a stat (see the enumeration above) followed by an interval
    - if it is owner0 or claim0, there's no separate stat block in the response
    - response: `{ ok, stats: { <room name>: { status, novice, own: { user, level }, <stat>: [ { user, value } ] } }, users: { <user's _id>: { _id, username, badge: { type, color1, color2, color3, param, flip } } } }`
    - `status` and `novice` are as per the `room-status` call
    - `level` can be 0 to indicate a reserved room

- `https://screeps.com/room-history/E1N8/12340.json`
    - `{ timestamp, room, base, ticks: { <time>: <tick update object> } }`
    - the number in the URL is the tick to retrieve information for (from 5e5 ticks ago to about 50 ticks ago)
        - note that the web interface only shows up to 3e5 ticks ago
    - the tick must be a multiple of 20; the response includes information for the 20 ticks starting then
    - for the first tick in the result, the tick update object maps from object ids to full object descriptions
    - for later ticks, the update includes only changed attributes
    - timestamp is milliseconds since the Unix epoch

- [POST] `https://screeps.com/user/activate-ptr`
    - `{ok, result: { ok, nModified, n }, connection: { id, host, port } }`
	- only works on the PTR
